						Hello! We are the Moldoveanu family and we want to talk a little

					<p class="description-text">
						The idea of boarding tourism is old! In 1987, while walking through
						the Iezer - Papusa massif, we found a deserted forest hut somewhere
						right at the entrance to the Riusor valley. With the help of a kind
						mountain rescuer, we got to know the head of the forest district
						from Cimpulung Muscel. Using the Union and the Tourism Club from the
						Oncological Institute where we were working together with Pic, my
						wife, we achieved something we did not really hoped for: we got
						entrusted with the cottage in custody.

						<span class="first-letter">I</span>n the '90s we managed to buy what
						the locals told us was a good place to stay. Now we have a house and
						a half-hectare plot of land where you can't leave. A boarding house
						also appears there. After the Revolution we enter the roller coaster
						of different businesses ... Better, less good ... Since '96 we have
						been struggling with a warehouse of construction materials that was
						missing on the way back and forth. Standing in the yard, I had a
						property of 2 houses. In the small house, a 2-room apartment where I
						had offices. Things were going so well that we started flirting with
						the idea of ​​emptying the offices, renovating them and renting them
						in a hotel system.
					</p>
					<p class="description-text">
						<span class="first-letter">I</span>t was a major change from what I
						had done for the last 15 years. We were coding. Mother had also
						heard of this idea. And she didn't code. Leaving on vacation in June
						2003, he simply took the workers from the company, moved our offices
						to the living room and began renovating the Small House. When we
						returned, I had taken the shot in the ass and was on the slide. At
						the end of August, my house was renovated and ... empty. We had run
						out of money. We had just told our friends and one of them, Dan,
						called us: Do you have a vacant house? "Very free" - we say that we
						knew the wind was blowing ... We find ourselves in half an hour with
						him at the gate with some customers. They had to stay in Bucharest
						for a month, they were staying at the Ambassador Hotel and they felt
						so good that they started looking elsewhere. After entering the
						yard, they asked us if they could bring their things that afternoon.
						Pic and I looked at each other and thought we had lost the first
						train ...
					</p>
					<p class="description-text">
						<span class="first-letter">W</span>e were not a little surprised
						when, finding out how free the house is, we spent 48 hours
						furnishing. He borrows money, runs after furniture, TV, etc., etc.
						and in the allotted time I had a fully equipped room. Two days after
						they settled in, they called other colleagues ... The Bulgarians had
						begun to roll. Every month more customers, a new body put into use
						.... We started to taste our little success: the satisfaction of
						satisfied people, who feed our account with a smile on their face!

<!--	With the help of our Trabant and the Union, we managed to restore the
					ruin and make a pleasant place where more and more people began to
					spend their free days: the cottage - THE GATE'S GATE. In the '90s I
					made a mistake: leaving the institute, instead of buying the cottage
					(then it was still possible…) I considered fair play to give it to the
					Union. Indifference spread over our cottage. In a few months it was
					looted and burned. The dust was gone, but the walk was not over. In
					'89, making a train trip to Slanic Prahova, through the village of
					Cotofenesti we see somewhere outside the village under a hillside,
					between the forest and the river an old house just emerged. We don't
					stop to think, we get off the train at first and quickly get to ask
					the locals if it's not for sale (it wasn't inhabited). People scratch
					their necks and ask me why we want that house far from the village
					(about 400m!), Under the forest, where wolves still howl in winter?
					They all led us to other houses further down the road, further into
					the world. But they have no one to get along with. We wanted that.-->
